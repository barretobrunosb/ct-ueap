Este reposit **Demic Diffusion and Cultural Transmission? Assessing the spread of Koriabo Tradition as an archaeological correlate of the Cariban language expansions**, presented to the journal *Antiquity*.

It contains the radiocarbon dataset table, the code used for radiocarbon modeling, and the linguistic database used in building a preliminary language phylogeny for the Cariban Languages.

## **Abstract:** 

Between AD 1000 and 1500, the Koriabo Tradition experienced a zenith of expansion that extended across the Guianas and the lower Amazon. Its presence endured even into the 16th and 17th centuries in the Caribbean and selected regions of the Amazon. Astonishingly, despite its extensive geographic reach, the ceramics associated with this tradition displayed striking consistency in both their decorative motifs and vessel shapes. In this paper, we employ radiocarbon modelling to delve into the hypothesis of Koriabo expansion, suggesting a dual process marked by cultural transmission and demic diffusion closely linked to the Cariban Languages. We posit that this dynamic interplay would have facilitated rapid dissemination and contributed to the establishment of more uniform archaeological patterns across the landscape.
